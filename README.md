## Description

Takshaka Patch is a port of the Takshaka Supersaw Oscillator Desktop Synthesizer project to the Eurorack format using the Daisy Seed Patch.  It features:  

- Voltage Controlled Supersaw Oscillator with Voltage control over Frequency, Drift, and Shift controls
- SubOscillator with Tri and Square waveshapes
- Resonant LowPass Filter with Voltage Control over cutoff
- Comb Filter with Voltage Control over frequency
- Wobbler provides random changes to various parameters of the synth to create effects ranging from subtle to chaotic

## Operation  

**Takshaka Patch** uses the Daisy Seed Patch's OLED display and encoder to provide 3 pages of settings:  

- **Page 1** - This page sets the Encoder Button to switch between Filter Modes (Low Pass Filter, Comb Filter) and sets the four knobs on the Daisy Seed Patch to control the following parameters:
  1. Filter Frequency
  2. Filter Resonance / Delay Time
  3. Drift Amount
  4. Shift Amount
    
- **Page 2** - This page sets the Encoder Button to switch between SubOscillator Modes (Tri 1, Tri2, Square 1, Square 2) and sets the four knobs on the Daisy Seed Patch to control the following parameters:
  1. Coarse Pitch
  2. Fine Pitch
  3. SubOscillator Mix
  4. Drive Amount
    
- **Page 3** - This page sets the Encoder Button to switch between Wobbler Modes (Wobble 1, Wobble 2) and sets the four knobs on the Daisy Seed Patch to control the following parameters:
  1. Wobbler Amount
  2. Cutoff CV Attenutation
  3. Drift CV Attenuation
  4. Shift CV Attenuation
